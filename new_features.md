# New Planned Features

*   [x] Reformat the run.sh script into an install script and run script

    *   [x] Ensure documentation reflects this change

*   [x] GET TESTS WORKING AGAIN ( they do not run at the moment)&#x20; (sanjit)

*   [x] Create a GUI page that shows all the budget information at once

    *   [x] Create API endpoints for all functions

        *   [x] Ensure tests are written and pass for the api endpoint calls

    *   [x] Create react front end app that calls the flask app serving the api endpoint

        *   There should be a page or function for every function that already exists in the app, this means we need a function for:

            *   [x] budget view (with per category view)(sanjit)

            *   [x] budget update (with per category update)(sanjit)

            *   [x] budget delete (with per category delete)(sanjit)

            *   [x] add a new spending record(sanjit)

            *   [x] add a recurring spending record(sanjit)

            *   [x] edit spending

            *   [x] category functionality (ARUL)

                *   [x] add new category

                *   [x] delete new category

                *   [x] show all custom categories

*   [x] Create a telegram functionality that opens the GUI webpage (sanjit)

*   [x] Ensure github workflows work and pass

This is a checklist for after the changes above are made. Treat this as a checklist ensuring functionality continues to work
